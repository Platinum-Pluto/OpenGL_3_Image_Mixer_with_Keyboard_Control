# OpenGL 3D Image Mixer with Keyboard Control

## Overview
This C++ project utilizes OpenGL to create a visually engaging 2D three rotating cards. Users can dynamically change the textures of each card using designated keyboard inputs. The keybinds for texture switching are as follows:
-  W-S
-  R-F
-  UP-DOWN

Each card has two textures, providing users with the flexibility to switch between them seamlessly.

## Requirements
- GLFW
- glm
- stb_image
