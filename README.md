# OpenGL_3_Image_Mixer_with_Keyboard_Control
In this project I added three rotating cards which can change their textures with user given inputs. Each card have their own keybinds to changing their textures. The keybinds are W-S, R-F and UP-DOWN and each card has two textures which the user can change the texture into. 
Requirements: GLFW, glm and stb_image
The code is written in C++ and it requires all the dependencies to work properly.
